What Can UIMA Be Used For
UIMA
is, by itself, an empty framework.
Its purpose is to enable a world-wide, diverse community to develop inter-operable, often complex analytic components, and allow them to be combined and run together, with framework supplied scaled-out and remoting as needed.
Some of the major external UIMA resources are linked on the Apache UIMA website "UIMA Resources on the Web".
You can also check the UIMA Addons and Sandbox for components that can be used and combined to build your own application.
There are lots of use cases where UIMA may be applicable.
One of the major ones are search applications.
Within search applications, the unstructured content that is available mainly as text in various kinds must be processed and analyzed to be searchable.
To obtain a powerful search application, the text content must be analyzed to get the document language followed by language dependent linguistic processing such as tokenization, lemmatization and part of speech detection.
After these steps a more sophisticated analysis like entity detection and relation detection between entities can be done.
For all these analysis steps UIMA and UIMA components can be used.
Another important use case is business or government intelligence.
For example, UIMA analysis is used to extract structured information from car repair reports.
This data is then used for quality feed-back and problem early warning systems.
Other possible solutions where UIMA can be used for are the analsyis of call center notes to detect product problems and customer issues or a public image monitoring solution to find out how others for example in internet forums or press releases think about my product or company.
